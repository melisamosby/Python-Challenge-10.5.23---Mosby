Module 3 Challenge contained the creation of two Python files and corresponding text files.

The first one, PyBank, involved writing code and using 'for' loops and if statements.  

The second one, PyPoll, involved calculating the results of an election by writing 'for' loops and calculating percentages.

I had some difficulty with writing basic math problems in Python. However, I eventually figured it out.
